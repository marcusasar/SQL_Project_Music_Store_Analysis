# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis

SQL project to analyze online music store data

I examined the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering simple questions.

SQL Queries? Check them out here [Project_SQL Folder](Project_SQL)

# Background

**The questions I answered through my SQL queries were:**

1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
2. Which countries have the most Invoices?
3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?
4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money.
5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer.
6. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners.
7. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset.
8. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.
9. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
customer name, artist name and total spent
10. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the
most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query
that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum
number of purchases is shared return all Genres
11. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each
country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how
much they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all
customers who spent this amount

# Tools I Used

For my deep analysis into the sales, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the music store data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
